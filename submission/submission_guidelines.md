### Submission Guidelines

In order to submit you solution, simply create a folder having folder name of your github username and within that folder, submit your solutions 
for the problems.

-----------------------------------------------

For example,

* create folder under submission folder like this `submission/prateekiiest`
* under this new folder create  folder for the problem you are solving and its solution file - like `submission/prateekiiest/problem-1/solution.cpp`
